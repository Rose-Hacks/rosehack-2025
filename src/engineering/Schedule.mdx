# Schedule

#### 6th June 2024 By Jonathan Trujillo

## What is it?

A schedule is essential for any hackathon as it allows for a concise and organized plan of events. Having a well-structured schedule helps participants manage their time effectively and provides clear information about the start and end times of the hackathon, workshops, meal breaks, and deadlines for project submissions. Additionally, this allows the organizers to run the event smoothly, avoid any overlaps, and ensure that all necessary resources are available at the right time.

## How did we implement it?

In its initial implementation, the schedule was a client component, but we eventually transitioned it to a server component with the Google Calendar API, allowing events to be loaded asynchronously.

The latest iteration uses React Server Components, creating a calendar wrapper that calls the API server-side and loads all the data.

```js title="src\components\admin\services\calendar\CalendarWrapper.jsx"
const CalendarEvents = async () => {
  return (
    <div className="relative h-screen">
      <CalendarWrapper events={rawEvents} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default CalendarEvents;
```

The benefit of using Google Calendar is its seamless event updating, as organizers only need to update the Google Calendar, and these changes are immediately reflected in the schedule component.

it used to be client side
and now its server side
and u can also talk bout the dynamic side of things
and how since the schedule is always on gcal, its always updated
go deeper into implementation
this implementation was only possible cause of RSC

## How did we do it before?

## What was the new change?

## Issues encountered

there was a small timezone bug we ran into
with UTC vs PST
that was messing up our parsing
and we had to pick a standard and run with it
cause we were miss classifiying events after 5-6pm PST
cause thats when UTC enters a new day
